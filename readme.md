## Invoice App

An application meant to facilitate the process of writing up a traditional invoice.
Keeping track of goods sent and services provided should be a computer's job.

## Getting Started
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Andrei0872/invoice-app.git
```

```bash
cd client/ && npm i && cd - && cd server/ && npm i && cd -
```

```bash
cp server/.env.example server/.env
# Then, add the information needed
```

```bash
# Open a new terminal tab (CTRL + SHIFT + T)
cd client/ && npm run serve
cd server/ && npm run dev
```

## Behind the scenes

### A common pattern for *provider*, *product* and *document* entities.
All the above mentioned entities rely on a single piece of logic([a vuex module](https://github.com/Andrei0872/vue-invoice-app/blob/master/client/src/store/modules/common/index.js) + common methods found in a [mixin](https://github.com/Andrei0872/vue-invoice-app/blob/master/client/src/mixins/commonMixin.js)) that it's been written once
and used multiple times.

### History

This project stems from my desire to improve my knowledge through building applications.  
Knowing that this application could also help someone, that motivated me even more.
